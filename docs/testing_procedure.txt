Issues found:

(1) Plone root instance users (those not in the 'tests' site), do not have the required attributes (mostly the registration dates). This causes exceptions when you click on any of the registration viewlet links.

(2) As a normal user you cannot register for a service with a cost of '0' credits. This is due to a bit of code in emas.theme.browser.views.EmasTransactionView.buyService which asserts that the cost of the transaction is greater than '0'.

(3) After buying directly from the registration popup the service cost is incorrect. Looks like I am showing the wrong service cost.
