                <h3>You don't have access to Intelligent Practice right now</h3>

                <p>Why?</p>

                <p>When your account was created you either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>paid for subscribtion and your subscription has expired, or</li>
                    <li>you automatically had access via our time-limited, free trial and that has expired.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>What can you do about this?</p>

                <p>You need to <a href="#" tal:attributes="href string:${context/absolute_url}/@@order">subscribe to Intelligent Practice</a>. 
                    If your school signed you up then you should ask your 
                    teacher what the status of the school's subscription is. 
                    If you signed up individually you need to renew your 
                    subscription via the <a href="#" tal:attributes="href string:${context/absolute_url}/@@order">orders page</a>.</p>

                <p>Even if your school signed you up originally, you can make an 
                    individual order to extend your account.</p>

                <p>What about my previous data?</p>

                <p>We don't delete your Intelligent Practice history for 3 months. As 
                long as you subscribe again within 3 months your history will still be 
                available and Intelligent Practice will be able to use that 
                information to give you better advice.</p>
